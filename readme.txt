🏥 U.S. Healthcare Equity & Hospital Performance Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project investigates the critical relationship between community socioeconomic status and the quality of clinical healthcare. By analyzing a dataset of over 5,000 U.S. hospitals, I developed an interactive dashboard to visualize how Median Household Income correlates with Clinical Risk Scores (such as mortality and safety measures).

The core objective was to determine if an "Equity Gap" exists in the American healthcare system—mathematically proving whether lower-income communities face higher clinical risks.

📊 Key Insights & Findings
The Equity Gap: My analysis confirms a Negative Correlation between income and clinical risk. As community income decreases, hospital risk scores significantly increase.

Regional Hotspots: Using geospatial mapping, I identified specific states where healthcare performance is significantly below the National Average.

Statistical Proof: The linear trend lines in the scatter plot provide visual evidence that high-income areas benefit from a "safety net" of better clinical outcomes compared to low-income counterparts.

🛠️ Tech Stack & Skills
Data Visualization: Tableau Desktop (Interactive Dashboards, LOD Expressions, Advanced Mapping).

Data Engineering: Python & SQL (Used for data cleaning, merging healthcare metrics with ZIP-code-based socioeconomic data, and feature engineering).

Statistics: Linear Regression, Correlation Analysis, and Data Aggregation.

Design: Custom "7 Vogue" Premium Dark Theme for high-contrast, executive-level reporting.

🧩 Dashboard Components
1. Executive Summary (KPIs)
Total Hospitals: A count of all unique facilities analyzed.

National Avg Score: The baseline benchmark for the entire country.

Performance Gap: The calculated difference in quality between the highest and lowest income tiers.

2. Geographic Discovery (Interactive Map)
A color-coded map of the USA that allows users to filter the entire dashboard by state to see regional disparities.

3. Correlation Analysis (Scatter Plot)
A scatter plot comparing Average Income (X-axis) vs. Clinical Score (Y-axis), featuring trend lines for each income tier to prove systemic bias.
