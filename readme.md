🏥 U.S. Healthcare Equity & Hospital Performance Analysis
📌 Project Overview
This project is a deep-dive into Healthcare Equity, exploring whether a community’s wealth (Median Household Income) directly impacts the quality of clinical care provided by local hospitals. By analyzing a master dataset of over 5,000 U.S. facilities, I built a high-end analytical dashboard to prove the correlation between economic status and clinical risk.

📊 Technical Components
National Benchmarking: Established a baseline National Average Score to measure performance deviation across different states.

Geospatial Analysis: Developed an interactive USA Map to identify "Clinical Hotspots" where performance is falling behind.

Correlation Modeling: Used Scatter Plots with linear trend lines to mathematically prove the "Equity Gap".

Custom UI/UX: Applied a premium "7 Vogue" Dark Theme to ensure the data "glows" and is easy for executives to read.

👥 Who Benefits from This Project?
This analysis isn't just a student project; it provides value to multiple professional sectors:

Healthcare Administrators: To identify which of their facilities are underperforming relative to national standards.

Policy Makers & Government: To see exactly which low-income regions require more funding and medical resources to close the equity gap.

Public Health Researchers: To use the correlation data as a foundation for studying the "social determinants of health".

Data Scientists/Recruiters: To see a live example of Level of Detail (LOD) expressions, data cleaning, and professional storytelling.

🏁 Conclusion & Outcome
The most significant outcome of this project is the Statistical Confirmation of the Equity Gap.

The data clearly shows that as Median Household Income decreases, Clinical Risk Scores increase. By centralizing this data into a single dashboard, we move away from "guessing" and toward data-driven decision-making. The better outcome here is the ability to target healthcare interventions with surgical precision, potentially improving survival rates in vulnerable communities.
